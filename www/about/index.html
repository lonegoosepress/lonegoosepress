      <h1>About the Press</h1>

<p>lone goose press is dedicated to excellence in the crafts of typographic design, letterpress printing and bookbinding. Over the last two decades, proprietor Sandy Tilcock’s work has been recognized for its impeccable and imaginative craftsmanship and design. The subtlety and refinement of her work keeps it understated, in keeping with her philosophy, “Do good work and allow the work to speak for itself.” Sandy has been involved with traditional book arts for over 25 years. Her quest to explore more deeply the craft of hand bookbinding led her to enroll at the University of Alabama’s Book Arts Institute, where she completed a Master of Fine arts degree in 1987. While at Alabama, she developed an interest in printing and typography, studying letterpress printing with the Institute’s director, Richard-Gabriel Rummonds. Sandy was founding Director of Knight Library Press at the University of Oregon and served in that position for seven years.</p>

<p>The work of the Press falls into three areas: fine press publishing; commission work including letterpress printing, binding and boxmaking; and non letterpress design projects.</p>

<p>The Press publishes limited edition letterpress printed broadsides and handbound books, working in collaboration with exceptional contemporary writers and artists.</p>

<p>Commission work includes designing, printing and production of suites of portfolio prints, books, broadsides, edition binding and boxmaking for other printers/publishers, as well as one-of-a-kind bindings and boxes.</p>

<p>Non letterpress design projects include consulting, advising, designing and production management of publications that are produced with technology other than letterpress.</p>

<h2>Sandy Tilcock, Owner</h2>

<p>Sandy has always had a passion for freedom. On long summer evenings as a child she treasured the ability to get on her bicycle and ride to the outskirts of town, exploring the edges of her world, delighting in the play of possibilities, returning at nightfall full of dreams. To this day she most loves the inviting warmth and expansiveness of that time of year. To her friends who prefer the cooler months she makes no apology for her midsummer affinity: “What can I say? I’m a tomato!”</p>

<p>The play of possibilities led Sandy to explore several pathways. As a mathematics major in college, she developed a disciplined, analytical approach to problems as well as an appreciation for what mathematicians call “the elegant solution”. A love of nature led her to photography back in the days when this craft inevitably meant contriving a darkroom and becoming intimate with chemical trays and timers. She was captivated by the sense of revelation in the play of light on surfaces. Over the years she became a passionate gardener. In that domain she tends to shun regimentation—she is the gentle advocate of chaos, delighting in the wild and unexpected. She has recently discovered the art of Bonsai, and enjoys the patient dialogue between plant and person, the gradual teasing out of the elegant solution.</p>

<p>Beyond her backyard, Sandy has long been an environmental advocate, devoted to preserving and protecting wild lands and waters. lone goose press derives its name from a passage in Aldo Leopold’s Sand County Almanac. Leopold’s curious observation of the occasional solitary Canada Goose during the spring migration resonated with her sense of sudden isolation starting a one- person enterprise after leaving the collegial support of the graduate program at Alabama.</p>

<p>Sandy is devoted to her dogs, current census 3. They would describe her as loving, generous and attentive, though they would probably agree that she works too hard.</p>

<p>In her work as in her life, Sandy values not just the elegant solution, but peace, harmony and understanding. She still seeks to venture to the outskirts in visual and verbal expression, nurturing an endless supply of dreams.</p>
