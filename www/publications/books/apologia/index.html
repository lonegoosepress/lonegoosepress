  <p>Individual folios hinged together to form a more than 20-foot-long continuous image; bound in boards using Lama Li handmade paper and original USGS topographic maps of the State of Wyoming.</p>

<p>Enclosed in a folder on the back cover, on an original USGS topographic map of Wyoming, is a tire-tread print made by Barry Lopez with the assistance of Sandy Tilcock, using the inked tire of Barry’s Toyota 4-Runner, the vehicle driven on the journey from Oregon to Indiana that is chronicled in the essay.</p>

<p>Housed in a clamshell box covered with black Canapetta book cloth, with a paper label on the spine.</p>

<p>The 23 woodblocks were carved on poplar by Robin Eschner, of Forestville, California, over a period of six years. Charles Hobson, of San Francisco, designed and organized the edition, which was printed by Susan Acker at Feathered Serpent Press, Novato, California. The woodblocks were made into an edition by Nora Pauwels at the Kala Art Institute in Berkeley, California. John DeMerritt, of Emeryville, California, hinged the text pages and bound the book. Sandy Tilcock of lone goose press, Eugene, Oregon, produced the boxes.</p>

<p>This was an unusual project, in that I did not have responsibility for all the production work but oversaw those who did the work and published it under my imprint. It came about because the original publisher was unable to follow through due to illness. Robin was anxious to see the book completed and be included in a large exhibition based on Barry Lopez’s writings scheduled at a gallery in San Francisco. Barry approached me and asked if I would become the publisher and shepherd the project to completion. We had only three months to produce the book, so no one person would be able to do all the work. It became a team approach. As the publisher, my role was to assure that everyone was on task so we could meet the deadline. Since we were hiring out much of the work, it was important to find funding. Barry and I worked together and solicited pre-publication subscribers. It was a crazy undertaking but we met the deadline and as a result I developed several good friends. I had daily conversations with both Charles Hobson and Robin Eschner. When the book was done I found myself missing those conversations as they embraced more than the book. Robin and I soon discovered a shared passion for the canine family, and my friendship with her continues today. I have also had the privilege to work with her since then. My relationship with Barry continues. Some project memories: my dog Ursula riding in the truck with Barry when he drove over the maps; Robin collapsing in laughter as I described over the phone “a little trouble with registration” while printing the tire treads.</p>
