  <p>The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.</p>

<p>The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.</p>

<p>We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.</p>

<p>It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human.
We make men at it, we make women.</p>

<p>At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.</p>

<p>Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.</p>

<p>This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.</p>

<p>Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.</p>

<p>We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.</p>

<p>At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse.
We give thanks.</p>

<p>Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and
crying, eating of the last sweet bite.</p>

<p>From How We Became Human: New and Selected Poems: 1975 - 2001, copyright 2002 by Joy Harjo, W. W. Norton &amp; Company.</p>
