## Letter by Letter

Patrick Tilcock - February 26th 2015

Welcome to lone goose press's new website. Incongruous as it might be for an enterprise dedicated to traditional book arts to engage with the light-speed world of internet communication, here we are!

Sandy has entrusted the care and feeding of this blog to me. I think her rationale was that I, as her partner and fellow-traveler over the past 40-plus years, might have some insight into the joys and challenges of the craft she has chosen. I hope to honor the work of the press and to prompt some lively dialogue on the place of bookcraft in the contemporary world of communication.

For those of you who are familiar with the press, we hope you will find a bit of inspiration and learn what Sandy and friends have been up to for the past several years.

For those who are new to the press, we invite you to explore the range of Sandy's work and gain an understanding of her work within the world of printing and publishing.

For those who are less familiar with the process of letterpress printing and the making of books by hand, perhaps you will be intrigued as to why, in an age of instantaneous communication and automated publishing, people like Sandy, in rented shops, garages, basements and backyard studios, still take the time to set metal type letter by letter, to painstakingly fold and gather groups of printed sheets, stitching them together with waxed linen thread as workers in the book trade did centuries ago.

There are probably as many opinions about the esthetics and taxonomy of "artist's books" and "book arts" in general as there are practitioners putting ink on paper. It is not our purpose to promote any particular views on this topic, but to generate appreciation for bookcraft is all its forms.

We welcome your questions and comments.

Watch this space!

All of Him is a letterpress book. It is also an adventure which has occupied the press for the past several four years. It is a set of ten poems, five each by brothers Matthew and Michael Dickman, with artwork by Keith Achepohl. As this project nears completion, we will be sharing some of the saga of its progress from conception to execution.
