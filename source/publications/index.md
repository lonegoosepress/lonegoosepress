# Publications

The core of the press’s work is rooted in a passion for traditional forms and methods of setting words on paper. It is about creating beautiful, valued artifacts, but always in service of the text. Any imagery is carefully selected and incorporated to honor the author’s words. The goal is to produce a worthy vesse for writings with urgency and relevance for our time. For the most part the texts are contemporary; the techniques are consistent with those common prior to the industrial expansion of the publishing industry.
