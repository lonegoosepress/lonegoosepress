# Poetic Prayer Flags

This special project of the press brings together brief pieces of writing by various authors in a format inspired by the Tibetan tradition of prayer flags. The writings may be new or excerpted from previous works. We ask the authors to consider themes of hope, peace, reconciliation, and respect for nature. The series is ongoing, each piece having the same format so that several flags may be strung ogether. This effort springs from a desire to cultivate visions for the future that counterbalance the despair and cynicism that often seem to prevail in our society.
