    <h2 class="text-center trailer-2">Poetic Prayer Flags</h2>

    <p>This project brings together brief pieces of writing by various authors in a format inspired by the Tibetan tradition of prayer flags. The writings may be new or excerpted from previous works. The authors were asked to consider the themes of hope, peace, reconciliation, and respect for nature. This effort springs from a desire to cultivate visions for the future that counterbalance the despair and cynicism that often seem to prevail in our society. There is no end date for this series, and the number of writings is not specified. The edition size of each flag will not exceed 97 copies. All the flags will have the same format: an 8 x 8 inch square of Japanese paper on which the text is printed. This is then sewn to a 10 x 10 inch square of cloth custom-batiked with an enso image. The cloth is hemmed to form a loop at the top edge to accommodate a string to be used for hanging.</p>

    <p>A hinged-lid box is available for storing the series. The box is covered in black mohair cloth and has black closing clasps handmade in India of buffalo bone. A window in the front of the box allows for a printed label mounted on a shallow pedestal. The box has a tray within a tray so that the strings are accommodated without their lying on the flag.</p>
