# Chapbooks, Keepsakes and Ephemera

Some lone goose press publications take the form of small booklets or chapbooks. In earlier centuries such inexpensive works, featuring illustrated poems and stories, were sold by itinerant peddlers, outside the mainstream of commercial book production. Keepsakes may be various kinds of small, intimate printed items produced in editions for specific events, or just for the sheer pleasure of setting ink on paper. The press also produces ephemera such as our traditional “Weathergrams” which are shared among friends and may be given to guests at studio events or receptions.
