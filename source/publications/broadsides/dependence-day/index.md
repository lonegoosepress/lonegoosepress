It would be a quieter holiday, no ﬁreworks<br>
or loud parades, no speeches, no salutes to any ﬂag,<br>
a day of staying home instead of crowding away,<br>
a day we celebrate nothing gained in war<br>
but what we’re given—how the sun’s warmth<br>
is democratic, touching everyone,<br>
and the rain is democratic too,<br>
how the strongest branches in the wind<br>
give themselves as they resist, resist<br>
and give themselves, how birds could have no freedom<br>
without the planet’s weight to wing against,<br>
how Earth itself could come to be<br>
only when a whirling cloud of dust<br>
pledged allegiance as a world<br>
circling dependently around a star, and the star<br>
blossomed into ﬁre from the ash of other stars,<br>
and once, at the dark zero of our time,<br>
a blaze of revolutionary light<br>
exploded out of nowhere, out of nothing,<br>
because nothing needed the light,<br>
as the brilliance of the light itself needs nothing.<br>
