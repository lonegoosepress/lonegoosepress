Among my pencil peers in the cup
I am freshly sharpened

In line with the doors of development
I am bright and new

Among the waves in the ocean
I soar the highest

Among weapons
I shoot the farthest

Among brothers
I am the tallest

But among the lines of ego
Mine is the biggest

Among the mirrors of superstition
I am shattered

Among friendships, I am alone
