Tell me why it is we don’t lift our voices these days<br>
And cry over what is happening. Have you noticed<br>
The plans are made for Iraq and the ice cap is melting?<br>
I say to myself: “Go on, cry. What’s the sense<br>
Of being an adult and having no voice? Cry out!<br>
See who will answer! This is Call and Answer!”<br>

We will have to call especially loud to reach<br>
Our angels, who are hard of hearing; they are hiding<br>
In the jugs of silence filled during our wars.<br>

Have we agreed to so many wars that we can’t<br>
Escape from silence? If we don’t lift our voices, we allow<br>
Others (who are ourselves) to rob the house.<br>

How come we’ve listened to the great criers—Neruda,<br>
Akhmatova, Thoreau, Frederick Douglass—and now<br>
We’re silent as sparrows in the little bushes?<br>

Some masters say our life lasts only seven days.<br>
Where are we in the week? Is it Thursday yet?<br>
Hurry, cry now! Soon Sunday night will come.<br>
