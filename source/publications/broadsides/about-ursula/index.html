  <p>Ursula (1995-2005) positioned herself at the foot of the press upon her ﬁrst visit to lone goose  press as a six week old puppy. Her sheer delight in welcoming visitors soon earned her the title “Director of Public Relations.” “About Ursula”, written several years before Ursula’s death, was retrieved from Patrick’s notebook. Memories of Ursula: her disarming habit of licking the bare knees of the UPS delivery person and other guests, her conversations with writer Barry Lopez, her deftly hiding rawhide chews under the studio equipment in order to taunt her canine sisters.  Primarily, we will remember the joy and laughter she brought to our lives.</p>
