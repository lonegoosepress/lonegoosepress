Our flag<br>
should be green<br>
to represent an ocean.<br>
It should have two stars<br>
in the first canton,<br>
for us and navigation.<br>
They should be of gold thread,<br>
placed diagonally,<br>
and not solid,<br>
but comprised of lines.<br>
Our flag should be silky jet.<br>
It should have a wound,<br>
a red river the sun must ford<br>
when flown at half-mast.<br>
It should have the first letter<br>
of every alphabet ever.<br>
When folded into a triangle<br>
an embroidered eighth note<br>
should rest on top<br>
or an odd-pinnate,<br>
with an argentine stem,<br>
a fiery leaf, a small branch<br>
signifying the impossible song.<br>
Or maybe honey and blue<br>
with a centered white pinion.<br>
Our flag should be a veil<br>
that makes the night weep<br>
when it comes to dance,<br>
a birthday present we open<br>
upon death, the abyss we sleep<br>
under. Our flag should hold<br>
failure like light glinting<br>
in a headdress of water.<br>
It should hold the moon<br>
as the severed head<br>
of a white animal<br>
and we should carry it<br>
to hospitals and funerals,<br>
to police stations and law offices.<br>
It should live, divided,<br>
deepening its yellows<br>
and reds, flaunting itself<br>
in a dead gray afternoon sky.<br>
Our flag should be seen<br>
at weddings well after<br>
we've departed.<br>
It should stir in the heat<br>
above the tables and music.<br>
It should watch our friends<br>
join and separate<br>
and laugh as they go out<br>
under the clouded night<br>
for cold air and cigarettes.<br>
Our flag should sing<br>
when we cannot,<br>
praise when we cannot,<br>
rejoice when we cannot.<br>
Let it be a reminder.<br>
Let it be the aperture,<br>
the net, the rope of dark stars.<br>
Let it be mathematics.<br>
Let it be the eloquence<br>
of the process shining<br>
on the page, a beacon<br>
on the edge of a continent.<br>
Let its warnings be dismissed.<br>
Let it be insignificant<br>
and let its insignificance shine.<br>
