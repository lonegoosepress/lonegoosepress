You already knew that. Reaching down,<br>
Scooping and shaping with bare hands,<br>
Absorbed and entranced with the dark,<br>
Grainy soil that clings to your skin, you know<br>
In your bones the boundless mystery<br>
Reaching back thousands of years<br>
In this patch of prairie where we have camped<br>
For the past thirty-four. You know<br>
There is a connection I miss<br>
With my practical gloves<br>
And long-handled tools, an ancient<br>
Wisdom that seeps into your blood,<br>
Carrying countless generations<br>
Of grass-songs and oak-stories.<br>
You touch an ancient prairie-fire<br>
Of gratitude, a rough blessing<br>
You carry in your blood as you work<br>
On hands and knees,<br>
Teasing out the roots of weeds,<br>
Tending the delicate future.<br>
