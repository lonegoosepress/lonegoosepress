```
We were contracted with the prison crew
	to take the ridge. Tear it down.
 Trees, Scotch broom, fence posts.
	It was too hot to smoke cigarettes.
 My chainsaw touched a whole world
	of yellow jackets in a beetle-rotten stump
 and my skin went tight. I lay facedown
	in the duff after the crew boss shot me
 full of something he kept in his saw bag.
	An inmate carried half a hunting dog
 like an armful of cedar bolts
	from the last stand of brush.
 What was left was swollen with ants.
	The vise in my throat bore down,
 daylight broke its bones across the ridge.
	Tear it down. From there you could see
 the whole town. Tear it down, tear it down.
