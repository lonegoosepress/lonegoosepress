As I’m walking down the street,<br>
Darkness closes 'round my feet,<br>
Still at noon and stars are bright,<br>
Just one thin ring of sun sheds light<br>

Stars appear and fireflies gleam<br>
Is this real or a crazy dream?<br>
Moon is powerful for a day,<br>
Blocking the light of the sun away<br>

One small thing hides all we see,<br>
Real life hidden in obscurity,<br>
What spot eclipses your real-world view?<br>
What moon conceals the sun that’s you?<br>
