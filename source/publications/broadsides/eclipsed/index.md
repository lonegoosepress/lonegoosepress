As I’m walking down the street,
Darkness closes 'round my feet,
Still at noon and stars are bright,
Just one thin ring of sun sheds light

Stars appear and fireflies gleam
Is this real or a crazy dream?
Moon is powerful for a day,
Blocking the light of the sun away

One small thing hides all we see,
Real life hidden in obscurity,
What spot eclipses your real-world view?
What moon conceals the sun that’s you?
