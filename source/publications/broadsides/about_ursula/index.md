My guardian angel has shining eyes.<br>
Sometimes I think she is indifferent,<br>
but she has deep, amber shining eyes.<br>
I am probably not her only client.<br>
She has clear, insistent eyes<br>
and amazing, jagged brown lips.<br>

There are morning visitations,<br>
when she shoves her black<br>
bearlike muzzle into my face<br>
to lick the sleepiness from my eyes.<br>
I want her to teach me about<br>
being awake, about being present<br>
and having vision, perhaps<br>
about being big and shaggy<br>
and infinitely tender.<br>
I am her guardian angel.<br>
She is not my only client<br>

Ursula (1995-2005) positioned herself at the foot of the press upon her ﬁrst visit to lone goose  press as a six week old puppy. Her sheer delight in welcoming visitors soon earned her the title “Director of Public Relations.” “About Ursula”, written several years before Ursula’s death, was retrieved from Patrick’s notebook. Memories of Ursula: her disarming habit of licking the bare knees of the UPS delivery person and other guests, her conversations with writer Barry Lopez, her deftly hiding rawhide chews under the studio equipment in order to taunt her canine sisters. Primarily, we will remember the joy and laughter she brought to our lives.
