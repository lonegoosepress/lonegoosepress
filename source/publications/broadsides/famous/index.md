The river is famous to the fish.

The loud voice is famous to silence,<br>
which knew it would inherit the earth<br>
before anybody said so.<br>

The cat sleeping on the fence is famous to the birds<br>
watching him from the birdhouse.<br>

The tear is famous, briefly, to the cheek.

The idea you carry close to your bosom<br>
is famous to your bosom.<br>

The boot is famous to the earth,<br>
more famous than the dress shoe,<br>
which is famous only to floors.<br>

The bent photograph is famous to the one who carries it<br>
and not at all famous to the one who is pictured.<br>

I want to be famous to shuffling men<br>
who smile while crossing streets,<br>
sticky children in grocery lines,<br>
famous as the one who smiled back.<br>

I want to be famous in the way a pulley is famous,<br>
or a buttonhole, not because it did anything spectacular,<br>
but because it never forgot what it could do.<br>
