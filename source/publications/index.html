    <p>The core of the press’s work is rooted in a passion for traditional forms and methods of setting words on paper. It is about creating beautiful, valued artifacts, but always in service of the text. Any imagery is carefully selected and incorporated to honor the author’s words. The goal is to produce a worthy vessel for writings with urgency and relevance for our time. For the most part the texts are contemporary; the techniques are consistent with those common prior to the industrial expansion of the publishing industry.</p>

      <p>From the earliest days of movable type, printers have worked with the limits presented by the size and format of the press, producing a single sheet of printed paper at a time. While this process was quickly adapted for the printing of books, the single­sheet format was often used for official announcements and proclamations. As the technology became more widely available, it also became a vehicle for political agitation. Dissident printers in back­alley shops sometimes cranked out calls for insurrection or reproduced scaffold speeches by condemned prisoners. The term broadside continues to carry the connotation of challenging the prevailing structures of power and ideology.</p>

      <p>While lone goose press’s approach to broadsides may be more reflective than inflammatory, we tend to seek poems or short prose essays that challenge us to perceive a deeper understanding of citizenship in this world.</p>

      <p>This special project of the press brings together brief pieces of writing by various authors in a format inspired by the Tibetan tradition of prayer flags. The writings may be new or excerpted from previous works. We ask the authors to consider themes of hope, peace, reconciliation, and respect for nature. The series is ongoing, each piece having the same format so that several flags may be strung together. This effort springs from a desire to cultivate visions for the future that counterbalance the despair and cynicism that often seem to prevail in our society.</p>

      <p>Some lone goose press publications take the form of small booklets or chapbooks. In earlier centuries such inexpensive works, featuring illustrated poems and stories, were sold by itinerant peddlers, outside the mainstream of commercial book production. Keepsakes may be various kinds of small, intimate printed items produced in editions for specific events, or just for the sheer pleasure of setting ink on paper. The press also produces ephemera such as our traditional “Weathergrams” which are shared among friends and may be given to guests at studio events or receptions.</p>
