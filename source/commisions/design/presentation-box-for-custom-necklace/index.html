title: Presentation Box for Custom Necklace
---


<p>I designed a modified clamshell box which would allow storage of the pendant chain when not in use. The necklace is displayed on a riser with shapes cut to accommodate the necklace components. Within that structure is a lidded compartment for the chain. These components are flush, so that when the box is closed, the necklace is held securely in place. The top panel is held closed using a bone clasp which slips into a loop.</p>

<p>Tomâ€™s client was delighted with the necklace and the box, so much so she felt it needed to be shared with more than her circle of friends, and so decided to donate it to the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC where it is a part of the Craft + Design Collection.</p>
