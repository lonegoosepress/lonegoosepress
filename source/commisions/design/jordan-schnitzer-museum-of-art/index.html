<p>I selected an accordion fold structure, a common Oriental binding style. I chose to use a Japanese paper, Kitakata, for the interior text and image, and Lokta handmade papers from Nepal for the accent and cover papers. On the front cover I employed a chopstick stained with printing ink to harmonize with the Lokta paper. Attached with paper loops, this decorative element also serves as a the mechanism for hanging the unfolded book on a wall.The Kitakata paper lends itself well to digital printing, allowing me to reproduce the photo of Gertrude Bass Warner for the edition. For the "chop", I worked with lettering artist Marilyn Reaves to develop a design incorporating the initials JSMA.</p>
