  description: "I was asked by the University of Oregon's Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art to design and produce an award that the Museum would give annually to those who made a significant contribution to the museum, either as a volunteer or in another capacity. It was to be named the Gertrude Bass Warner Award, honoring the history of the building. The museum was built in 1933 to house the Murray Warner Collection of Oriental Art—more than 3,700 works of art given to the University of Oregon by Gertrude Bass Warner. The award was to be of an intimate scale, and either be hung on a wall or easily tucked into a bookshelf. It was also to incorporate a photo of Gertrude Bass Warner taken on her travels, and text provided by museum staff. They also wanted a logo-like image designed for the museum that was contemporary but evoked the look of an east Asian “chop” or signature. I had 3 weeks to design and execute this award."

  release: '1996'
  description: 'Florida Jeweler Tom McCarthy received a commission for a special necklace in white and yellow gold. The necklace he created was reversible and incorporated a pendant that could be be removed and worn independently on a chain. Tom asked me to create a one-of-a-kind box to house and present the necklace. Since it was not feasible for Tom to ship the necklace across the continent, I was to work from a to-scale drawing.'
