## Hi, I'm Paul.

I design and develop digital experiences. I work at a research and development office in Portland, Oregon focused on location-based technologies. You can find me online just about everywhere as @paulcpederson.

This site was built using [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [Wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). You can find the source on [my github](https://github.com/paulcpederson/).
